# Spam Detection

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to identify spam messages using ML models. 

## Data Import
- **Data Source**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), which is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. 
- 5,574 English messages, tagged as ham (legitimate) or spam.

*Side note: Given the size of the dataset, it is not necessary to apply Spark. The use of Spark is for demonstration purpose.*
